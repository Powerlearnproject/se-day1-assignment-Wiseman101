Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The Birth of Software Engineering (1968)
In the 1960s, software projects were chaotic—costly delays, unreliable systems, and unmanageable code. The NATO Software Engineering Conference in 1968 introduced the idea of treating software development like traditional engineering, leading to structured approaches and better practices.

The Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (1980s)
 Languages like C++ (1983) and Java (1995) introduced reusable, modular code, making it easier to build and maintain complex software.

The Agile Revolution (2001-Present)
 In 2001, the Agile Manifesto introduced flexible, fast, and collaborative approaches like Scrum and Kanban, making software development more adaptable to change.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning – This phase involves defining the project scope, goals, resources, budget, and risks. It ensures that the development process is well-structured and feasible.

Requirement Analysis – Developers and stakeholders gather and document software requirements, including functional and non-functional needs. This phase helps in understanding what the software should achieve.

Design – In this phase, the system architecture, user interface, and database design are created. It serves as a blueprint for developers to follow. Implement use of objects and classes.

Implementation (Coding) – Developers write the actual code based on the design specifications. This phase involves programming and integrating different software components.

Testing – The software is tested for bugs, errors, and security vulnerabilities. Various testing techniques such as unit testing, integration testing, and system testing are applied.

Deployment – The tested software is released to the users. It may be deployed in phases, such as beta testing before full production release.

Maintenance – After deployment, the software is monitored for any issues or required updates. Maintenance includes bug fixes, security patches, and feature enhancements.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Feature	Waterfall	Agile
Waterfall is Sequential and linear while agile is	Iterative and incremental
Waterfall is rigid, changes are difficult once a phase is completed wheareas agile	highly flexible, changes can be made anytime
Development Phases follows a strict sequence planning to design to implementation to testing to deployment then maintenance in waterfall while Agile	uses sprints or iterations where planning, development, and testing occur simultaneously
 Waterfall promotes client Involvement	but Agile limited to the initial and final stages	Continuous client feedback is encouraged throughout the process
Testing	Done after development is completed	 while in agile integrated into each iteration
Final product is delivered at the end in waterfall but in agile	Small functional increments are delivered frequently

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
When you're coding, you want things to be as smooth and efficient as possible. That’s where Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) come in—they make life easier for developers by handling a lot of the heavy lifting.

1. Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) – Your Coding Command Center
Imagine trying to write code in a plain text editor with no highlights, no auto-complete, and no way to catch errors early. That would be frustrating, right? IDEs solve that by giving you a complete toolkit in one place:

A code editor that highlights errors and suggests fixes.
A debugger to help you spot and fix mistakes.
A compiler that converts your code into a working program.
Built-in Git support to track your changes.
Why IDEs ??

They speed up development with smart suggestions and shortcuts.
They help you catch errors early, saving you from debugging nightmares.
They bring everything together, so you don’t have to juggle multiple tools.
 Examples of IDEs:

VS Code – A lightweight yet powerful editor with tons of extensions.
IntelliJ IDEA – A go-to for Java developers with smart features.
PyCharm – The best friend of Python developers.
2. Version Control Systems (VCS) – Your Time Machine for Code
Ever made a change that broke everything and wished you could go back? That’s exactly what Version Control Systems (VCS) are for. They track every change in your code, letting you:

Revert to an earlier version if something goes wrong.
Collaborate with a team without messing up each other’s work.
Work on different features simultaneously using branches.


Saves you from disasters by keeping a history of every change.
Allows multiple developers to work on the same project without conflicts.
Makes it easier to experiment without breaking the main codebase.
 Examples of VCS:

Git – The most popular system, used with GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.
SVN (Subversion) – Still used in some enterprise settings.
Mercurial – A Git alternative with a simpler workflow.uss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Helps detect usability issues that developers might overlook.
Decides whether the software is ready for deployment.



Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of crafting effective prompts to communicate with AI models and achieve desired responses. It involves structuring input in a way that guides the AI to generate accurate, relevant, and high-quality outputs.

 Importantance:
 Enhances AI Performance – Well-designed prompts lead to clearer, more accurate responses.
 Reduces Ambiguity – AI models can interpret vague inputs in unintended ways; precise prompts improve reliability.
 Saves Time & Effort – A well-crafted prompt reduces the need for multiple revisions or clarifications.
 Optimizes AI Applications – In fields like customer support, content generation, and programming assistance, strong prompts improve efficiency.

Key Techniques in Prompt Engineering
1. Be Specific & Clear 
2. Provide Context – AI performs better with background details.
3. Use Step-by-Step Instructions – Explain how a neural network works, step by step, in simple terms.
4. Experiment & Refine – If the response isn’t what you expected, tweak the wording for better accuracy.
5. Use Constraints – Summarize this article in 100 words or less.
6. Chatbots & Virtual Assistants – Well-structured prompts ensure natural, helpful responses.
7. Code Generation – Engineers use prompts to get AI-generated scripts, debugging help, or algorithm explanations.
8. Content Creation – Marketers and writers craft prompts for AI-generated blogs, ads, or product descriptions.
9. Data Analysis – Analysts use prompts to generate reports, summaries, and insights from raw data.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: "Talk about technology"

Improved Prompt: "Explain the basics of tecnnology, including its definition, key components, real-world applications, advantages and disadvantages."

Why the Improved Prompt is More Effective?
More Specific – It narrows the focus to essential topics like definition, types, and applications, making the response more structured.
Clearer Intent – It explicitly asks for key and important points about technogy avoiding a generic explanation.
Concise Yet Detailed – It balances brevity with detail, ensuring a comprehensive yet focused responses.
